## Emily Adams

## Goal:  
***My goal is to gain a better understanding of object oriented programming and what it means for different languages.***
## Interesting Fact About Me:
An interesting fact about me is that I have just upgraded my PC setup and now I have an extremely beefy computer. A
- 5070TI graphics card, and a 
- Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU. 
Perfect for coding... and playing Minecraft.
### Code Example:
```
doYou = input("Do you know the muffin man? ")
if doYou == "yes":
    print(f"I do too. He lives on Drury Lane.")
```
